When the user creates a custom pattern and saves it. It works perfectly initially. But, if the user closes out of the app and goes back into it the pattern does not work correctly anymore and is defaulted to these White light assets/views. This must have something to do with the local storage not being saved properly for the new implementation of the lights in assets/lights and useLightAssets.

Please investigate this.
